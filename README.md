# BMI-Calculator-web-app

First web app. So In this project we have used Node js &  Express to work on the server of the web app of a Normal calculator as well as a BMI Calculator. Also using JS the logic of the BMI and calculations were derived.
In the hyper terminal we installed Express, then we installed nodemone npm package. Also body-parser was added to allow us to pass the information that we get from the post request.
